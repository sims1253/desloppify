# Work Queue

How items flow from scan results into the execution queue that `desloppify next` returns.

## Core concepts

- **`queue_order`** is the durable ordering source (persisted in plan JSON).
- **Phase gate** controls visibility — re-resolved from live items every build, not from persisted phase.
- **`auto_queue` detectors** (`unused`, `logs`) auto-inject into `queue_order` without triage.
- See `policy.py` for the readable queue model summary.
- See `docs/QUEUE_LIFECYCLE.md` for phase lifecycle rules.

## Lifecycle phases

Phase is determined by `_phase_for_snapshot()` from the persisted lifecycle mode plus
live item partitions. Legacy fine-grained phase names are migrated once by
`current_lifecycle_phase()` before snapshot resolution.

1. **LIFECYCLE_PHASE_REVIEW_INITIAL** — fresh boundary, no scores yet. Shows subjective review items.
   Objective items are NOT visible until initial review completes.

2. **LIFECYCLE_PHASE_EXECUTE** — the main work phase. Shows objective (mechanical defect) items.
   Only issues in `queue_order` are executable (post-triage). Pre-triage: all objectives visible.

3. **LIFECYCLE_PHASE_SCAN** / **LIFECYCLE_PHASE_*_POSTFLIGHT** — workflow items (rescan, communicate score,
   assessment, triage). These gate the execution phase.

## Auto-queue vs triage-promoted

Detectors with `auto_queue=True` in the registry (currently: `unused`, `logs`) get
`execution_status=active` and `execution_policy=ephemeral_autopromote` at cluster creation.
Their issues auto-inject into `queue_order`.

All other detectors require triage to promote their clusters to active. The precedence
for determining execution policy is: **explicit persisted field → registry `auto_queue` → string-sniffing fallback**.

## Module map

```
snapshot.py          build_queue_snapshot() — canonical entry point
  → ranking.py       build_issue_items() — creates WorkQueueItem dicts from state
  → selection.py     items_for_visibility() — filters by execution/backlog view
  → finalize.py      finalize_queue() — enriches with impact, stamps plan position, sorts
  → plan_order.py    stamp_plan_sort_keys(), collapse_clusters()
  → synthetic.py     build_subjective_items(), build_triage_stage_items()
  → synthetic_workflow.py  workflow items (scan, review, communicate-score, deferred)
policy.py            should_auto_queue(), explain_queue() — readable rules + explainability
models.py            QueueBuildOptions, QueueSnapshot, WorkQueueResult
```

## Sort order (`item_sort_key` in ranking.py)

```
Tier 0: _TIER_PLANNED   — items with explicit plan position (by plan_pos)
Tier 1: _TIER_EXISTING  — known items without plan position (by natural sort)
Tier 2: _TIER_NEW       — newly discovered items (by natural sort)

Natural sort (within each tier):
  _RANK_CLUSTER=0 → clusters first, by action_type (auto_fix=0, refactor=1, manual_fix=2)
  _RANK_ISSUE=1   → individual issues, by -impact, confidence, -count, id
```

## Key types

- `WorkQueueItem` (types.py) — TypedDict with id, kind, detector, file, etc.
- `QueueSnapshot` (snapshot.py) — the full snapshot: execution_items, backlog_items, phase, counts
- `_Partitions` (snapshot.py) — intermediate grouping before phase resolution
